        <h2>Types of Student Accommodation in Toronto</h2>
        <p>Toronto provides a wide range of housing options to cater to students’ diverse needs. Understanding these options can help you make an informed choice.</p>

        <h3>1. Rooms for Rent</h3>
        <p><b>Rooms for rent</b> are among the most popular choices for students. These can be in shared apartments, houses, or townhouses. Renting a room allows students to enjoy privacy while living in a social environment. Many listings provide private bathrooms, WiFi, and furnished bedrooms. Some even offer access to communal areas like kitchens, lounges, or games rooms.</p>
        <p>Weekly rent for rooms in Toronto typically ranges from $240 to $600, depending on the location and amenities. Downtown Toronto tends to be more expensive due to proximity to major universities like the University of Toronto, OCAD, and George Brown College. Suburban neighborhoods such as Scarborough or North York often provide more affordable options.</p>

        <h3>2. Homestays</h3>
        <p>For international students or those new to the city, <b>homestays</b> are an excellent way to ease into life in Toronto. Homestays involve living with a local family, often including meals such as breakfast and dinner. Many homestays in Toronto are vegetarian- and LGBTQ-friendly, creating a safe and welcoming environment for students.</p>
        <p>Homestays provide more than just accommodation; they offer cultural immersion and a supportive atmosphere. Students can learn local customs, improve language skills, and get guidance on navigating the city, making it an ideal choice for newcomers.</p>

        <h3>3. Apartments and Townhouses</h3>
        <p>Some students prefer the independence of renting an entire <b>apartment or townhouse</b>. These options offer complete privacy and flexibility. Apartments can range from small studio units to large multi-bedroom townhouses. Many come equipped with central heating, air conditioning, in-unit laundry, and access to amenities like gyms or pools.</p>
        <p>While apartments are generally more expensive than shared rooms or homestays, they are perfect for students who value privacy and autonomy. <a href="https://assets.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/sites/cmhc/professional/housing-markets-data-and-research/market-reports/rental-market-report/rental-market-report-2022-en.pdf">The weekly rent for apartments in Toronto ranges from $400 to over $900</a>, depending on size, location, and included facilities.</p>
